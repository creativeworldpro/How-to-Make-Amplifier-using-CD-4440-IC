In this series of articles on amplifiers, we will give you a complete guide on how to make your own amplifier circuit. Where we start by finding out what the proposed circuit should do and how it can be done.
The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. They supply high quality PCBs at a very reasonable price. They also can provide SMT circuit assembly.

The final circuit diagram and design can be seen above. We also thank to our sponsor JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/RTA) for sponsoring us PCB for this project.

This is a simple and easy to build project that anyone can do. This amp circuit makes use of transistors, sound IC, capacitors and resistors to complete this project.

Throughout this project, we'll be exploring the ins and outs of amplifier design, from choosing the right components to fine-tuning the circuit for optimal performance. Whether you're a seasoned electronics pro or just starting out, there's something here for everyone.

We encourage you to ask questions, share your own insights and experiences, and collaborate with your fellow project members as we work towards our goal of building an exceptional amplifier circuit. Let's get started!



Component List - 

When it comes to creating an amplifier circuit, it’s important to have the right components in your list. An amplifier circuit can be used for a variety of applications such as listening song, stage program, cultural program, and other also. Having the right components is essential to ensure that your amplifier circuit works properly and efficiently.

In this article, we’ll discuss some essential components that should be included in your amplifier circuit component list

To make this amplifier circuit, we might need some electronics component. Those component lists have to been given below.

Component List:

1. PCB – made by JLCPCB

2. Sound IC - CD 4440

3. Capacitor - 100µf/ 25v and 10µf/ 25v

5. Resistor – 100 KΩ and 680 Ω

6. Audio input cable

6. Sound Speaker

7. Power Source – DC 12v


What is CD-4440 IC -

CD4440 is a type of integrated circuit (IC) that is commonly used as a power amplifier in audio systems. It is a dual-channel audio power amplifier that can deliver up to 6 watts of output power per channel when used with a 12V power supply.

The CD4440 IC has a built-in thermal shutdown protection feature, which prevents the IC from overheating and getting damaged. It also has a wide supply voltage range of 4V to 18V, making it suitable for use in a variety of audio applications.

The CD4440 IC is available in a 12-pin DIP (dual in-line package) or a surface-mount package, which makes it easy to integrate into various audio systems. It is a popular choice for DIY audio enthusiasts and hobbyists who want to build their own audio amplifiers or modify existing ones.


Specification of CD-4440 IC -

Here are the specifications of the CD4440 sound IC:

•	Supply voltage range: 4V to 18V

•	Maximum output power: 6 watts per channel (with 12V power supply)

•	Input impedance: 47 kohms

•	Output load impedance: 4 ohms to 8 ohms

•	Total harmonic distortion (THD): 0.3% (typical at 1kHz, 6W)

•	Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): 70dB (typical)

•	Channel separation: 40dB (typical)

•	Operating temperature range: -40°C to +85°C

•	Package type: 12-pin DIP or surface mount package

These specifications can vary depending on the manufacturer and specific model of the CD4440 IC. It's important to refer to the datasheet provided by the manufacturer for the specific IC being used to ensure accurate and reliable performance.


Connect 10µf/25v Capacitor with CD-4440 IC - 

To make this circuit, 1st we connect some common connection in this 14 legs of sound IC.  We connect 3, 6, 8 and 14 no leg of this sound IC. 
Then connect 10µf/25v capacitor positive leg with 1no leg of sound IC and connect another 10µf/25v capacitor positive leg with 7no leg of sound IC.

Now connect this two capacitors empty terminal with each other.


Connect Resistor with circuit - 

We are using two resistors to make this circuit. One is 680 Ω and the other one is 100 KΩ.
This time, we connect 680 Ω resistor with 3no leg of sound IC and it's other terminal with 10µf/25v capacitor negative leg.

Now connect 100 KΩ resistors with 2no leg of sound IC.


Connect 100µf/25v Capacitor with Circuit - 

We are using 3 pieces 100µf/ 25v capacitor. We connect 1st piece capacitor negative terminal with 3no leg of sound IC and it's positive terminal with 5no leg of sound IC.

Then we connect 2nd piece capacitor negative leg with 12no leg of sound IC and it's positive terminal with 13no leg of sound IC.

This time we connect 3rd piece capacitor positive leg with 9no leg of sound IC and it's negative terminal with 10no leg of sound IC.


Connect Audio Input Cable with Circuit - 

There are two cables of an audio input cable. One is called Ground cable and the other one is called Left/Right cable. 

Now we connect Ground cable with 14no leg of sound IC and connect Left/ Right cable with empty terminal of 100 KΩ resistors.


Connect Speaker Cable with Circuit - 
For output signal, now we need to connect a sound speaker with the circuit. We connect sound speaker one terminal with 10no leg of sound IC and another terminal with 12no leg of sound IC.


Connect Power Source with Circuit - 

For power source, we are using DC-12v power supply adaptor. To make this circuit, you also can use a 12v battery as a power source. Now connect DC-12v positive terminal with 11no leg of sound IC and negative terminal with 14no of sound IC.


Soldering And Cleaning - 
Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off  the extra leg of all electronics component.

We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.


Final Action - 
Our circuit, is now completely ready for use. Now just plug-in the audio source with amplifier circuit and enjoy the surrounding sound effect of this amplifier circuit
